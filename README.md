# lifecounter
Homework requirement:

My family enjoys playing Magic:The Gathering over dinner while we are out to eat in restaurants. We need an app to help track each player's "life total" during the game. It needs to run on Froyo. (Package it as "edu.washington.<yourNetID>.lifecounter")


Stories:

As a user, when I launch the application, it should show me four “players”. Each “player” should have a label for their life total, and four pushbuttons (“+”, “-“,”+5”,”-5”).
As a user, when I push the “+” pushbutton for player 1, it should increment player 1’s life total by 1. “-“ should reduce the life total by 1, “+5” should increment by 5, and “-5” should decrement by 5
As a user, when a player's life total drops to 0 or less, it should display a label at the bottom of the app saying "Player X LOSES!"
As a user, when I rotate the device (landscape to portrait mode or vice versa), it should resize itself evenly.
As a user, when I run the app on different devices, it should seem "equally balanced" on each device, regardless of orientation. Players' life total labels should be proportional, buttons proportional, and so on.
Homework Grading:

All your code should be in a GitHub repo under your account
repo should be called 'lifecounter'
repo should contain all necessary build artifacts
include a directory called "screenshots", including:
screenshot of app running on emulator
pic or screenshot or movie of app running on a device
 

We will clone and build it from the GH repo
5 points, one for each satisfied story
